sdlquake-autoclean
==================

sdlquake-autoclean.sh is a Bash script that performs several cleaning tasks to the original SDL Quake code 
(http://www.libsdl.org/projects/quake). Once executed, we can develop on it normally without suffering strange errors 
occasioned by obsolete stuff. 

### Instalation

Put the sdlquake-autoclean script file inside SDL Quake source folder and run it. That's all.
